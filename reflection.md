Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
Cafe 
- I overloaded makeCoffee to a default makeCoffee and a default makeCoffee if given a size because some people just want "a coffee" and some people just want a "small/large" coffee (meaning the boomers that get confused by flavor syrups).
Library
- I overloaded addTitle to also add an arraylist of titles if adding multiple titles. I also overloaded isAvailable to see all available titles instead of just checking if one title was available.
House
- I overloaded moveIn so that you can moveIn an arraylist of residents. I also did the same with moveOut.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I am confused about if this is working on A6 or A7 because how do I bring things from the subclasses to the CampusMap? I just copy and pasted cafe house and library into A7.
